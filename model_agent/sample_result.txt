Having assessed the model's performance during the financial crisis using a flat risk-free rate of 0.01, excluding the market factor, and applying a 15% bump to the size factor, here are the statistical insights:

### Model Estimation:
- **Size Factor Coefficient**: 1.0297
- **Value Factor Coefficient**: -0.963383
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: 0.0962554
- **Adjusted R-squared**: 0.0904248

The positive coefficient for the size factor suggests that larger firms performed comparably better, while the negative value factor indicates that companies with high book-to-market ratios possibly underperformed in this scenario. The R-squared value is relatively low, which implies that the model explains roughly 9.6% of the variance in returns. It's clear that additional factors might be needed to better capture the variability in stock returns during this period.

### Model Performance During the Financial Crisis:
The table below shows the predicted versus actual investment returns (Pred vs. Act):

| Date       | NVDA: Predicted | NVDA: Actual |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 2007-09-01 | -0.0051         | 0.0625       |
| 2007-10-01 | 0.0297          | -0.0237      |
| 2007-11-01 | -0.0256         | -0.1085      |
| ...        | ...             | ...          |
| 2009-05-01 | -0.0325         | -0.0915      |
| 2009-06-01 | 0.0574          | 0.0825       |

Throughout the crisis, the predicted values often did not align with actual market performances. For instance, significant discrepancies are seen during major market downturns, such as in January 2008 where the model predicted -0.0504 but the actual return was -0.2772, highlighting the challenges in capturing extreme market events in financial crises.

In summary, while the model incorporates some elements that align with intuitive expectations (like the size premium), it struggles with precision during highly volatile periods such as the financial crisis, lacking broader market factors which could potentially enhance the predictiveness and robustness of the model. This highlights the importance of considering additional data or refining existing parameters to better understand stock performance under various economic conditions.
